# Intro

More and more often I keep hearing about friends who get random private messages from their friends asking them to click a link and "Vote for my team in this competition" or something along those lines. The messages come from compromised accounts that are being used to take over even more accounts. I am not sure what the goal is, maybe the attacker is getting away with payment info stored in the account.

I decided to poke at the site because I look into phishing sites all the time at work when users report suspicious emails to us, and I find this kind of work enjoyable.

I decided to do a write-up of this because it's actually very well put together attack that looks legitimate on the surface and takes some effort and technical know-how to recognize as malicious.
