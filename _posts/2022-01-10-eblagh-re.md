# Intro
-----

Over the last few months I have been cultivating a new skill that I'm getting to use at work: Android malware reverse engineering and analysis. There is still a lot to learn, so I'm starting to look for more opportunities to practice. Fortunately, there are a couple of malware hunting accounts on Twitter who can feed me a steady flow of suspicious APKs to break down. For this write-up I'll be analyzing a sample of suspected malware that is **not** on the Play Store.

# Static Analysis with Open-Source Tools

## Finding a lead  
I started out by checking @malwrhunterteam on Twitter to see if they had recently pointed out any malicious APKs that I could analyze. Luckily for me, [they posted a fresh lead](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1480646267218890755) about an hour before I got off work.

## A little bit of OSINT  
I always like to do a bit of OSINT before I start digging into the code, to try to get an idea of what I'm getting into. A good starting place is taking the digest in the Tweet above and searching it in VirusTotal:

<center><i><small>Figure 1 - VirusTotal Analysis</small></i></center>  
<br/>  

It seems like some of the detections are coming back with `SmsSpy`, which leads me to initially believe that this could be spyware, so that is where I'll direct my efforts starting out.  
Next, I'll look around more in VT to see what else turns up:
<center><img src="/assets/images/eblagh-re/2.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 2 - Contacted Domains</small></i></center>  
<br/>  

It seems that some of the domains contacted by the app are coming back as malicious. It may be due to the fact that the `sanad-irani` domain is where the APK comes from. Unfortunately, the site appears to be down, which was disappointing because that stopped me from getting the APK.  
Fortunately, I remembered that if you have an account with VirusTotal, they allow you to download samples. Logging in, I got a copy of the APK, and started with the code analysis.

## Code Analysis  
The most important place to start an investigation is the `AndroidManifest.xml` file. This file is always packaged with APKs, and it is where permissions are declared, among other things. For this analysis, I am using [Jadx](https://github.com/skylot/jadx), an open-source tool for decompiling Java code.  
Going off my previous assumption that this is possibly spyware, I look for any SMS-related permissions:
<center><img src="/assets/images/eblagh-re/3.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 3 - Dangerous Permissions</small></i></center>  
<br/>  

To be fair, there are many potentially dangerous permissions found here, but I highlighted those related to SMS since I'm currently operating under the assumption that this is spyware. I am not sure what the advertised usage of this app is supposed to be, since the originating site is offline, but this combination of permissions is a big red flag.  

With this information in hand, I start looking for abuse of the `SmsManager` Android API:
<center><img src="/assets/images/eblagh-re/4.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 4 - Searching code for API calls</small></i></center>  
<br/>  

We see here that there are a few classes that are calling the `SmsManager` API. We'll have to drill into them one by one to see what's really going on. This can be done by double-clicking one of the entries, and I started with the 2nd from the top entry:
<center><img src="/assets/images/eblagh-re/5.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 5 - SMS Sender</small></i></center>  
<br/>  

Not quite what I was expecting, but this is still suspicious. Most people probably don't want an app sending text messages on their behalf. It's not clear what's being sent because the destination number and message body are stored in variables, which the method gets as arguments when it is called. So to start tracing what's happening, we need to see what's being passed to this code as it's called. In Jadx, this can be done by right-clicking and selecting `Find Usage` to begin tracing the call chain:
<center><img src="/assets/images/eblagh-re/6.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 6 - Back-tracing calls</small></i></center>  
<br/>  

<center><img src="/assets/images/eblagh-re/7.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 7 - Calls to `Send2`</small></i></center>  
<br/>  

The method is called by another method directly above it in the code. This method also gets the destination number and message body as arguments, so to learn more, we just keep back-tracing:
<center><img src="/assets/images/eblagh-re/8.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 8 - `Send2` called by `Send`</small></i></center>  
<br/>  

<center><img src="/assets/images/eblagh-re/9.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 9 - Dead code</small></i></center>  
<br/>  

The `Send` method does not appear to be called. This is known as "dead code", code that is defined but never called, so it never executes. This is a dead end, so we go back to searching for instances of `smsManager` and look at other classes using it:
<center><img src="/assets/images/eblagh-re/10.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 10 - Moving on</small></i></center>  
<br/>  

<center><img src="/assets/images/eblagh-re/11.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 11 - Another SMS sender</small></i></center>  
<br/>  

It appears that we found another method for sending text messages, but the code is a bit beefier. Towards the bottom of the snip, we see where the `SmsManager` API is being invoked. To see where the actual SMS is sent, we scroll down:
<center><img src="/assets/images/eblagh-re/12.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 12 - Invoking `sendMultipartTextMessage` API</small></i></center>  
<br/>  

Here we find a call to an API for sending multi-part text messages. To understand the arguments being passed to it, we can look up the API on the [Android developer web site](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/SmsManager#sendMultipartTextMessage(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String,%20java.util.List%3Cjava.lang.String%3E,%20java.util.List%3Candroid.app.PendingIntent%3E,%20java.util.List%3Candroid.app.PendingIntent%3E,%20long)):
<center><img src="/assets/images/eblagh-re/13.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 13 - API arguments</small></i></center>  
<br/>  

Referencing this, we learn that the first argument is the destination number, the second argument is the source number, the third is the message body, and the fourth and fifth arguments are the previously defined intents to verify that the message was sent and received.  
Now we resume the back-tracing of calls to see where this code is invoked:
<center><img src="/assets/images/eblagh-re/14.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 14 - Calls to the SMS sender</small></i></center>  
<br/>  

<center><img src="/assets/images/eblagh-re/15.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 15 - Highly suspicious code</small></i></center>  
<br/>  

There is a lot going on in this code, so let's break it down one thing at a time.  

First of all, this code looks like the app is receiving commands from somewhere and taking various actions based on the received message. This makes the app a borderline backdoor trojan, allowing an outside user to have some degree of control of the device via a C2.  

Secondly, we can see methods that, based on the command name, appear to be collecting and reading the user's stored text messages, and contacts. If this is taking place with no in-app disclosure, this would be the smoking-gun evidence to positively identify the app as spyware. We'll have to dig into that code a little more to confirm this.  

Third, it appears that the SMS sending method gets phone numbers from the device's address book. This activity could earn the app the designation of being spam, as it is covertly collecting the numbers of the victim's friends and family and blasting text messages out to them. That makes three different categories of malware that this app could fall under.  

We scroll up to find the name of the method with all of this potentially malicious code in it:
<center><img src="/assets/images/eblagh-re/16.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 16 - Firebase connector</small></i></center>  
<br/>  

Now this is slick. To avoid directly betraying the URL of the C2 by hard-coding the address, the app is connecting to a Firebase instance to get the commands. [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is an offering from Google that aids in the development of Android apps. It is not entirely uncommon to see malicious apps leveraging Firebase as a way of covertly contacting C2 servers, as traffic to Firebase URLs usually does not light up detections on VirusTotal or other automated scanners. Based on the code flow, this is how the app receives commands.  

Before I go into the rabbit hole of tracing the call chain more, I scrolled back down to the code for the "getContacts" command to confirm that the app is reading the victim's contacts:
<center><img src="/assets/images/eblagh-re/17.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 17 - Finding the contact harvester</small></i></center>  
<br/>  

<center><img src="/assets/images/eblagh-re/18.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 18 - Deeper tracing of contact collection</small></i></center>  
<br/>  

<center><img src="/assets/images/eblagh-re/19.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 19 - Contact collection</small></i></center>  
<br/>  

It appears that the code is attempting to leverage SQL queries to get contacts. I personally have not seen this method used before, so it's difficult to fully describe what is occuring here, but the evidence found so far very strongly suggests that this is where the app gets the contact details from the device.

After this confirmation, I go back to back-tracing the call chain to the method that contained the malicious code:
<center><img src="/assets/images/eblagh-re/20.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 20 - More dead code?</small></i></center>  
<br/>  

It was disappointing enough for this to happen once before, but having it happen again is pretty deflating. There aren't really any other leads for `SmsManager` to follow up on, so it's looking like we hit a brick wall.  
However, I tried looking for calls to the over *class* instead of just that method, and there seem to be many calls to it:
<center><img src="/assets/images/eblagh-re/25.png" /></center>
