# Intro
-----

Over the last few months I have been cultivating a new skill that I'm getting to use at work: Android malware reverse engineering and analysis. There is still a lot to learn, so I'm starting to look for more opportunities to practice. Fortunately, there are a couple of malware hunting accounts on Twitter who can feed me a steady flow of suspicious APKs to break down. For this write-up I'll be analyzing a sample of suspected malware that is **not** on the Play Store.

# Static Analysis with Open-Source Tools

## Finding a lead  
I started out by checking @malwrhunterteam on Twitter to see if they had recently pointed out any malicious APKs that I could analyze. Luckily for me, [they posted a fresh lead](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1480646267218890755) about an hour before I got off work.

## A little bit of OSINT  
I always like to do a bit of OSINT before I start digging into the code, to try to get an idea of what I'm getting into. A good starting place is taking the digest in the Tweet above and searching it in VirusTotal:

<br/>  

It seems like some of the detections are coming back with `SmsSpy`, which leads me to initially believe that this could be spyware, so that is where I'll direct my efforts starting out.  
Next, I'll look around more in VT to see what else turns up:

<center><i><small>Figure 2 - Contacted Domains</small></i></center>  
<br/>  

It seems that some of the domains contacted by the app are coming back as malicious. It may be due to the fact that the `sanad-irani` domain is where the APK comes from. Unfortunately, the site appears to be down, which was disappointing because that stopped me from getting the APK.  
Fortunately, I remembered that if you have an account with VirusTotal, they allow you to download samples. Logging in, I got a copy of the APK, and started with the code analysis.

## Code Analysis  
The most important place to start an investigation is the `AndroidManifest.xml` file. This file is always packaged with APKs, and it is where permissions are declared, among other things. For this analysis, I am using [Jadx](https://github.com/skylot/jadx), an open-source tool for decompiling Java code.  
Going off my previous assumption that this is possibly spyware, I look for any SMS-related permissions:
<center><img src="/assets/images/eblagh-re/3.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 3 - Dangerous Permissions</small></i></center>  
<br/>  

To be fair, there are many potentially dangerous permissions found here, but I highlighted those related to SMS since I'm currently operating under the assumption that this is spyware. I am not sure what the advertised usage of this app is supposed to be, since the originating site is offline, but this combination of permissions is a big red flag.  

With this information in hand, I start looking for abuse of the `smsManager` Android API:

<center><i><small>Figure 4 - Searching code for API calls</small></i></center>  
<br/>  

We see here that there are a few classes that are calling the `smsManager` API.
