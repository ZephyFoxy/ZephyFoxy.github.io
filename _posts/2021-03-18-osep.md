# Intro

I signed up for PEN-300 in November 2020, and started in December 2020, and over the next three months I worked on the course material every day. Watching videos, going through the PDF, replicating exercises, and eventually the challenge labs. I sat the exam on March 13th and met the passing objective on the 2nd day of testing. After getting the official passing email I've decided to write a review for the course.

# The course
-----

PEN-300 a new course released by Offensive Security and is meant to be a follow-up to the PWK/PEN-200 course. It takes on more complex topics such as AV evasion, kiosk escapes, bypassing Application Whitelisting, and exploiting misconfigurations in Active Directory. A full syllabus can be found here:
[PEN-300 Syllabus](https://www.offensive-security.com/documentation/PEN300-Syllabus.pdf)  

The course comes in increments of 60 or 90 days only, no 30 day option is available. In my opinion that is probably best; I initially only signed up for 60 days, and that was not enough, I ended up extending by another 30 days. The material is very in-depth and takes a while to work through, even if you have a chance to work on it on the clock.  

The course teaches almost all of the topics from scratch, assuming that students have not studied these topics previously, which makes it much easier to just pick up after finishing OSCP. I do not believe that extensive pre-study is required, unless you are weak in Active Directory, since this course *will assume* you already know some AD basics. If you took PWKv2, which had AD in it, then you are already set to jump directly into PEN-300.
