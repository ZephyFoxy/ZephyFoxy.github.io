# Intro
-----

At the time of writing, I am currently enrolled in Offensive Security's EXP-301/OSED course. One of the topics covered in the course is reverse engineering for bugs, which was one of my favorite modules. I wanted to get in a little extra practice so I came back to Vulnserver again, interested to see how complex it would be to reverse engineer it to discover the bugs.
<br/>

All testing was done on a Windows 10 v1910 VM with the firewall disabled, but Windows Defender enabled.

# Reverse Engineering Vulnserver with WinDbg and IDA Free

## Exploring vulnserver's functionality

We'll start by sending a generic network packet to vulnserver just to observe how it handles incoming data and understand code flow. The initial PoC is simple:

<center><i><small>Figure 1 - Starter PoC</small></i></center>  
<br/>

Fire up WinDbg and then attach `vulnserver.exe`. We should see a list of imported DLLs right at the start, which has some valuable information for our first step in reverse engineering:

<center><i><small>Figure 2 - Imported DLLs</small></i></center>  
<br/>

We start by seting a breakpoint at the `recv` function inside of `ws2_32.dll`. This is because `ws2_32.dll` is the library that vulnserver is using for network activity.

<br/>

Execute the PoC, and observe how the breakpoint is hit in WinDbg:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/4.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 4 - Breakpoint is hit</small></i></center>  
<br/>

We aren't really interested in stepping through this function, so use the `pt` command in WinDbg, which will continue execution until a `RET` instruction is encountered. Then use `p` to step a single instruction, and observe the address we land on:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/5.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 5 - Returning to the func that called recv</small></i></center>  
<br/>

Now we open IDA Free and load up vulnserver. Once it is finished with analysis, press the `g` key to bring up a search box, and type the address displayed by WinDbg:
<center><img src="/assets/images/trun_re/6.png" /></center>  
<center><i><small>Figure 6 - The code that calls recv</small></i></center>  
<br/>

The instructions following the call to `recv` will perform the following actions:  
* Move the contents of `EAX` onto the stack
* Compare this value to `0`
* Make a jump if this value is *less than or equal to* `0`

Let's see what is in `EAX`:
