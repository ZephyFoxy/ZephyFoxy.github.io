# Intro
-----

At the time of writing, I am currently enrolled in Offensive Security's EXP-301/OSED course. One of the topics covered in the course is reverse engineering for bugs, which was one of my favorite modules. I wanted to get in a little extra practice so I came back to Vulnserver again, interested to see how complex it would be to reverse engineer it to discover the bugs.
<br/>

All testing was done on a Windows 10 v1910 VM with the firewall disabled, but Windows Defender enabled.

## Exploring vulnserver's functionality

We'll start by sending a generic network packet to vulnserver just to observe how it handles incoming data and understand code flow. The initial PoC is simple:

<br/>

Fire up WinDbg and then attach `vulnserver.exe`. We should see a list of imported DLLs right at the start, which has some valuable information for our first step in reverse engineering:
